# geocoding
This model will geocode any street address using OSM Nominatim service.

Currently this code leverages OpenStreetMap (OSM) Nominatim service. However, as the coverage in OSM is not consistent across the globe, other publicly available gazetteers are being explored to call in this code for geocoding purpose. 
The code is flexible enough and can adapt/accommodate to other premium geocoding service, for example, Google geocoder or HERE geocoder.
